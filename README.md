# Chrome_Extensions
In this repository , I'll be storing all the chrome extensions I have developed and currently working on!

* To Use these extensions just download the files and folders from that Extension and save them to your device in a new folder (Name of the folder can be anything).
* Open Chrome Browser and search "chrome://extension" or go to "More tools -> Extensions" in your chrome settings.
* Enable "Developer" Mode and select "Load Unpacked" and navigate to the folder of Extension.
* Once done the extension is Ready-to-Go!!
